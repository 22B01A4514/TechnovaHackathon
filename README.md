**Disease Prediction System**
**Project Description**: A comprehensive disease prediction system designed to predict the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease based on their symptoms, provide hospital search functionality, estimate disease severity, and offer precautions to prevent disease spread. This system uses a Deep Learning Sequential model and a Node.js backend with a SQLite3 database to store and retrieve patient data.

**Technologies Used:**
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: SQLite3
Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js, Deep Learning Sequential model

**Features:**

**Disease Prediction from Symptoms:** uses a Deep Learning Sequential model to predict the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease based on their symptoms<br>
**Hospital Search:** allows users to search for nearby hospitals and filter results based on distance, rating, and availability<br>
**Disease Severity Estimation:** estimates the severity of a disease based on patient symptoms and medical history<br>
**Precautions:** provides users with precautions to prevent disease spread, including hygiene practices, vaccination recommendations, and lifestyle changes<br>
**Patient Data Management:** stores patient medical history and symptoms in a SQLite3 database<br>

**Goals:**
Reduce diagnosis time and cost
Enhance patient care and outcomes
Provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals
Empower patients to take preventive measures
